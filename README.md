This Deep Neural Network model was built completely with just NumPy. Without the help of any standard ML libraries. This will help you understand the Forward propagation with activation function (with multiiple hidden layers), the cost function calculation and back propagation with derived activation function implementations.

This code was made with the help of "Neural Networks and Deep Learning" course of Andrew Ng from Deeplearning.AI.
The dataset was provided in the course for practice. 

The same code can be used for any binary classification. A little bit tweaking of hyper-parameters will ensure that the model is stable for your dataset.
